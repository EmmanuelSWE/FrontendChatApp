how will the json look like: 
	like the objects duhhh...

what will the objects look like : 

	userSession{
	sid : string;
	createdAt : date; 
	endedAt : date;	
	user : user;
	
	startSession(); // will make user status to online
	endSession(); // will show offline
	get startTime(); 
	get endTime(); // will return either 0 or an actual date
	get user
	
	}

	User{	
	id : string;
	userName : string;
	Status : string;
	profilePhoto : string;	
	currentSession: session;

	static signUp()
	static login()
	logout()
	sendMessage(chatRoom,body) //sends messages to a spefic chat room 
	
	

	
	}



	chatRoom{
	cid : string;
	cname : string; 
	cType : string; (either private or group)
	chatNum: string;
	Messages : message[];
	members : users[];

	validateUsers(users) //checks if they are in the chat.. if not they must join 
	validateMesssage(); //

	sendMessageToChat(user) // may be redundant ill see if there is a need for it
		
	}


	messages{
	mid : string (format of cid, chat number)
	sender : uid;
	message : string;
	deleted : Boolean;
	createdAt date;
	cid : string;

	sendMessage(chatRoom); // this one will validate the text and make sure its okay - its looking useless too I can lie
	
	
	}
	
	
	chatRoomUsers{
	cid : string;
	uid : string;
	

	}



=== IDEAS :
The process? 
User signups.
goes to login.
logs in 
user selects an online or offline chat member.
chatroom is created 

if it is a group they must choose to join 

then one the chat section all the chats of the chatroom will load asynchornusly 
just top to bottom
then form the top to bottom 
they add another chat and it will get loaded...maybe I should load it from the bottom up hmm must decide late once ik how the local storage and session storage work.


how will they talk : 
ive heard of session storage on GitHub and local storage apparently they all talk together should look into in. They will have the same session storage. 


how will the user now the name and the chat ? 
maybe make the person the chat? but then too many chatrooms. 
why not use session storage... who ever's ID is in the storage look use chatRooms features to make it the name of the other person...

How will I display online users? 
look for all sessions with no end dates then they are online. 


Real time messaging : will have to look for a way 

research on the local and session storage.
