signal R???

chain of responsibility

'...'  the rest operator operator

why does const [a, ...c] = [1,2,3,4] make a= 1 and c =[2,3,4]
but const j = [1,2]
	const m  = [3,4]
	const result = [...j, ...m] 
	result = [1,2,3,4] and not [[1,2],[3,4]]

const is means mutable but cannot be reassigned to something else
